# ðŸŽ’Python Language Projects ðŸŒŸ
Hi! Welcome to my Finance Calculator Folder containg the Python Project ðŸš€:

In this repository you will see a description of the Finance Calculator project that I have developed as part of my personal progressive development of my code skills.

## Financial Calculator

## Overview
This Python program serves as a financial calculator that allows users to perform either an investment or bond calculation based on their input. The program provides a user-friendly menu with options to choose between investment and bond calculations.

## Features
**User Interaction**: The program greets the user and presents a menu with two options: "investment" and "bond." The user is prompted to enter their choice.

**Investment Calculation**: If the user selects "investment," they are prompted to input the deposit amount, interest rate, investment duration in years, and the type of interest (simple or compound). The program then calculates and displays the total amount after the specified investment period.

**Bond Calculation**: If the user selects "bond," they are prompted to input the present value of the house, interest rate, and the number of months for bond repayment. The program calculates and displays the monthly bond repayment.

**Error Handling**: The program includes error handling for invalid inputs, ensuring that users receive appropriate feedback for incorrect selections or entries.

## How to Use
**Menu Options**: Choose between "investment" or "bond" based on your financial calculation needs.

## Investment Calculation:

If choosing "investment," input the deposit amount, interest rate, investment duration in years, and select the interest type (simple or compound).
The program will calculate and display the total amount after the specified investment period.
Bond Calculation:

If choosing "bond," input the present value of the house, interest rate, and the number of months for bond repayment.
The program will calculate and display the monthly bond repayment.
Invalid Options:

If an invalid option is entered, the program will provide a message indicating that the option is not recognized. Users are then prompted to choose between "investment" or "bond."
Dependencies
The program utilizes the math library for mathematical calculations related to compound interest.

Feel free to explore different financial scenarios using this calculator, and please ensure to input valid data for accurate results.
