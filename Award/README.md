Hi! Welcome to triathlon Folder containg the Python Project ðŸš€:

In this repository you will see a description of the Tiathlon project that I have developed as part of my personal progressive development of my code skills.

## Triathlon Award Determination Program

## Overview
Welcome to the Triathlon Results Award program! This Python script is designed to determine the award a person competing in a triathlon will receive based on their performance times in swimming, cycling, and running. The program calculates the total triathlon time and assigns awards according to predefined criteria.

## Features
**User Interaction**: The program prompts the user to input their achieved times for swimming, cycling, and running.

**Total Triathlon Time Calculation**: The script calculates the total triathlon time by summing the individual times for swimming, cycling, and running.

**Award Determination**: Using logical conditions and comparison operators, the program determines the award category based on the total triathlon time.

**Award Categories**: The awards are categorized into "Provincial Colours," "Provincial Half Colours," and "Provincial Scroll," each corresponding to specific time ranges. If the user does not meet the qualifying time criteria, a message stating "Unfortunately, you have no award" is displayed.

## How to Use
**Input Times**: Enter your achieved times for swimming, cycling, and running when prompted by the program. Ensure you input times in minutes only.

**Award Determination**: The program will calculate the total triathlon time and determine the award based on the predefined time ranges.

**Award Output**: The script will output the award category you have earned. Awards include "Provincial Colours," "Provincial Half Colours," or "Provincial Scroll." If you do not meet the qualifying time criteria, the message "Unfortunately, you have no award" will be displayed.

## Caution
This program is designed for illustrative purposes and does not reflect actual triathlon award criteria. It serves as a simple example of how Python can be used to calculate and categorize data based on predefined conditions.

Feel free to modify the program to suit your needs or add additional award categories and criteria. Enjoy exploring the different awards based on your triathlon times!
