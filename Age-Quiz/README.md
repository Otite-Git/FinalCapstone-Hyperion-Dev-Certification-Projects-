Hi! Welcome to my Age Quiz Folder containg the Python Project 🚀:

In this repository you will see a description of the Age Quiz project that I have developed as part of my personal progressive development of my code skills.

 ## Age Quiz Program

## Overview
This Python program is designed to provide various responses based on the user's age input. The responses are tailored to specific age ranges and include messages related to milestones, retirement, and general age-related humor.

## Features
**User Interaction**: The program prompts the user to input their age to generate personalized responses.

**Conditional Statements**: Utilizing if, elif, and else statements, the program evaluates the user's age and outputs specific messages based on predefined conditions.

**Age Milestones**: Messages are provided for significant age milestones, such as turning 21 or reaching retirement age.

**Age Categories**: Responses differ for users aged 40 or older, those between 13 and 39, and those under the age of 13.

**Humorous Messages**: The program includes lighthearted and humorous messages, adding a touch of humor to the age-related responses.

## How to Use
**Age Input**: Enter your age when prompted by the program.

**Personalised Responses**: The program will output a response based on your age, including messages related to milestones, retirement, or humorous remarks.

**Variety of Messages**: Depending on your age, you may receive messages like "You're over the hill" for users aged 40 or older, "Congrats on your 21st!" for those turning 21, or "You qualify for the kiddie discount" for users under 13.

**Age is but a Number**: If your age does not fall into any predefined category, the program will provide the general message "Age is but a number."

## Caution
This program is intended for entertainment purposes and may include humorous content. It does not provide serious or personalized advice. Enjoy the lighthearted responses and have fun exploring different messages based on your age.

Feel free to modify or extend the program to include additional age ranges or responses.
