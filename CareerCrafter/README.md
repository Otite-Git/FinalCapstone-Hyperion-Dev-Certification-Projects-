# ðŸŽ’Python Language Projects ðŸŒŸ
Hi! Welcome to my CareerCrafter Folder containg the Python Project ðŸš€:

In this repository you will see a description of the CareerCrafter project that I have developed as part of my personal progressive development of my code skills.


## Personal Data Validation CareerCrafter Program

## Overview
This project involves the development of a program that validates personal data provided by a user for an application. The program utilises defensive programming techniques to ensure the accuracy and validity of the input data. The primary features of the program include:

**Input Validation**: Conditional statements are employed to validate user inputs, ensuring that the required information is provided and meets specific criteria.

**Error Handling**: The program incorporates try-except blocks to efficiently manage unexpected exceptions. This helps in identifying and addressing various error types, enhancing the overall robustness of the application.

**User Guidance**: The program guides the user through the application process by providing clear instructions and feedback, ensuring a smooth and error-free data entry experience.

## Usage
To successfully complete the application form, users are prompted to follow these steps:

**Enter first name and surname**: The program validates the presence of both first name and surname, displaying the full name in the correct format.

**Enter email address**: The program checks for the presence of '@' and '.' in the email address, ensuring its validity.

**Enter contact number**: The program verifies that the contact number is 11 digits long and consists of numeric characters only.

Enter age: Users are prompted to input their age, with the program handling non-negative integer values and providing appropriate feedback.

**Enter nationality**: The program validates that the nationality consists of alphabetic characters only.

## Output
Upon successful completion of the data entry process, the program generates a summary table displaying the collected information. This table includes details such as full name, email address, contact number, age, and nationality.

## Dependencies
The program relies on the tabulate library for presenting the collected information in a structured table format.

## How to Run
To execute the program, ensure that the required dependencies, especially the tabulate library, are installed. Run the script, and the program will guide you through the data validation process, providing feedback and summarizing the entered information at the end.

Feel free to contribute or provide feedback to enhance the functionality and user experience of the program.
