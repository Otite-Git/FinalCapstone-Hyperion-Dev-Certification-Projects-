# ðŸŽ’Python Language Projects ðŸŒŸ
Hi! Welcome to my Personal Dailywourk Routine Program Folder containg the Python Project ðŸš€:

In this repository you will see a description of the Personal Daily Workout Routine Program project that I have developed as part of my personal progressive development of my code skills.


## Personal Daily Workout Routine Program

## Overview
This Python program, known as Personal Program Trainer (PPT), serves as a personal daily workout routine generator. PPT tailors workout plans based on user preferences, fitness goals, and body mass index (BMI). The program aims to provide personalized exercise recommendations for achieving specific fitness objectives.

## Features
**BMI Calculation**: Users are prompted to input their current weight and height, and the program calculates their BMI. It then categorizes the BMI into different health weight categories according to the NHS standards.

**User Interaction**: PPT engages users by asking for their fitness goals, preferred workout duration, and the specific muscle group they want to target.

**Exercise Database**: The program utilizes a categorized exercise database, including exercises for various muscle groups. This database is dynamically incorporated into the workout routine based on user inputs.

**Personalised Workout Plans**: PPT generates personalized workout plans based on the user's BMI category and fitness goals. The plans include recommended exercises, sets, and reps for the targeted muscle group.

**Randomised Exercise Selection**: For variety and engagement, the program randomly selects exercises from the database, offering diverse workout routines.

**Consistency Reminder**: Users are encouraged to keep track of their progress, with a reminder that consistency is key for achieving desired results.

## How to Use
**BMI Calculation**: Enter your current weight in kilograms and your height in meters when prompted.

**BMI Evaluation**: Based on your BMI, the program categorizes you into underweight, healthy weight, overweight, or obese.

**Fitness Goals**: Specify your fitness goal, workout duration preference, and the muscle group you want to target.

**Personalised Workout**: PPT generates a personalized workout routine tailored to your BMI category and fitness goals. The routine includes suggested exercises, sets, and reps.

**Consistency Reminder**: The program concludes with a reminder to keep track of your progress and emphasizes the importance of consistency in achieving results.

## Dependencies
This program does not require external libraries beyond the standard Python library.

## Caution
Please consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new workout routine, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions. The program provides general recommendations and should not replace personalized advice from a healthcare provider.

Feel free to contribute or provide feedback to enhance the functionality and user experience of the program.
